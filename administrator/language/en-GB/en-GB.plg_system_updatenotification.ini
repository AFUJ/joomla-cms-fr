PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION="System - Joomla! Update Notification"
PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_DESCRIPTION="This plugin periodically checks for the availability of new Joomla! versions. When one is found it will send you an email, reminding you to update Joomla!. Pro Tip: You can customise the email message by overriding the language string keys PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SUBJECT and PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_EMAIL_BODY."

PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_EMAIL_LBL="Super User Emails"
PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_EMAIL_DESC="A comma separated list of the email addresses which will receive the update notification emails. The addresses in the list MUST belong to existing users of your site who have the Super User privilege. If none of the listed emails belongs to Super Users, or if it's left blank, all Super Users of this site will receive the update notification email."
PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_LANGUAGE_OVERRIDE_LBL="Email language"
PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_LANGUAGE_OVERRIDE_DESC="If you choose Auto (default), the update notification email to Super Users will be in the logged in user's front-end language at the time the plugin is triggered. In multi-language sites this can create confusion: the user's language may be one the Super User receiving the email doesn't speak. By selecting a language here you are forcing the update notification emails to be sent in this specific language."
PLG_SYSTEM_UPDATENOTIFICATION_LANGUAGE_OVERRIDE_NONE="Auto"
